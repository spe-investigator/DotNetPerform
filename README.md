# DotNetPerform
.NET does not make several key APIs infallible for developers to utilize. Instead, you have to understand the internal workings of .NET. This Nuget package aims to remove all fallibility from utilizing key .NET constructs in order to simplify and dumby-proof the APIs.

There are recenty additions to .NET Framework and Core that enable developers to **write additional code** in order to make existing APIs perform, as expected, however these APIs create added need to understand the internal performance characteristics.

They bring developers **closer** to internal performance concerns, rather than abstract them away.

The primary goal of this toolkit is to **almost entirely abstract** performance problems away from developers.

We hope you find this toolkit of performance useful.
